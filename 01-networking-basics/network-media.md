### Three media Types
- Metal wired within cables - data coded on electricl implulses
  - Ethernet cables use Twisted-pair Cable. UTP|| Coaxial Cable
- Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) - data encoded on pules of light
  - Fiber optics is immune to electromagnetic inteference due to not haveing copper, which is present in both Ethernet cables and coaxial cables.
- Wireless Transmission- data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves
