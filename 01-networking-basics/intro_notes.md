## Local Networks (1.1.4)
- SOHO (Small office/Home office): SOHO networks let you share resources( Printer, documents, pictures...) between a few local users.
- - The Small Office Home Office (SOHO) network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources.

## The bit (1.2.2)
- bit ( binary digit) - smallest form of data
-  A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits.
-  Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.

## Common Methods of Data Transmission (1.2.3)
- Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air.

### There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
- Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

- In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi-enabled wireless connections. Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.

# 1.3
## Bandwidth (1.3.1)
- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that theoretically can travel across the medium in a second.

### Units of Bandwidth and Values
- Kbps Kilobits per second ( 1 thousand bps)
- Mbps Megabits per second ( 1 million bps)
- Gbps Gigabits per second ( 1 billion bps)
- Tbps Terabits per second ( 1 trillion bps)

## Throughput (1.3.2)
- While bandwidth is the maximum potential data transfer rate, throughput is the actual data transfer rate.

### Factors that might affect throughput
- The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
- The types of data being transmitted
- The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

- Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

### In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device.
