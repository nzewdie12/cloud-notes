## Common Methods of Data Transmission (1.2.3)
- Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air.

### There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
- Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
