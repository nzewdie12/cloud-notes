## Clients and servers' roles (2.1.2)

### All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.

- Servers are hosts that have software installed that allows them to provide information to other hosts on the network.
- Clients are hosts that have software installed that allows them to request and display information received from servers. Clients' software is usually a web browser

### Software type and descriptions
- Email:
  - Server will run the software, and the client will use a mail client server, such as Microsoft Outlook
- Web:
  - Client uses browser software such as Internet Explorer.
- File:
  - The file server stores corporate and user files in a centralized location. The client device accesses these files with client software, such as Windows File Explorer.

## Peer-to-peer networks (2.1.3)
- Computers that act as both a server and a client on the same local network are a peer-to-peer network.
- Basic advantages:
  - easy set up, low cost, less complex
- Basic disadvantages:
  - not scalable, not as secure, slow performance

## Peer-to-peer Applicaiton (2.1.4)
-  P2P application requires that each end device have a user interface and a background service.
  - Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory (unlike WhatsApp, which goes through WhatsApp servers)

## A single computer can run multiple types of server software and can connect to multiple hosts. Also, a client computer can have multiple client software.

## Three categories of network components
- End devices (aka. Host devices): laptops, printers, phone, camera...
  - An end device (or host) is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network, as shown in the animation. In order to uniquely identify hosts, addresses are used.
- intermediary devices: switches, routers, firewall
- network media:
  - Lan (local area network media): Ethernet cable
  - WAN (wide area network media): fiber optic cables
  - Wireless Media: radio frequency, infrared waves

## ISPs
- An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the Internet.
- additional services: These services can include email accounts, network storage, website hosting, and automated backup or security services.
- Never use a moddem to directly connect an end device to an ISP. Instead, have a  wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP.  The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts.
- Can be run over DSL(over phone land lines) or Cable(over cable tv lines)
  - DSL requires a high-speed modem to separate the 3 connections: phone, download, and upload
  - Cable requires a modem to separate the internet from phone services.
- Cellular, satellite, and dial-up telephones are also other options.
