## Clients and servers roles (2.1.2)

### All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.

- Servers are hosts that have software installed that allows them provide information to other hosts on the network.
- clients are hosts that have software installed that allows them to request and display information recived from servers. Clinets sofware are usually web browsers

### Sofware type and discriptions
- Email:
  - Server will run the software and the client will use a mail client server, such as Microsoft Outlook
- Web:
  - Client uses browser software such as Internet Explorer.
- File:
  - the file server stores corparete and user fiels in a centeralized location. The client device accesse these files with client software, such as Windows File Explorer.

## Peer-to-peer networks (2.1.3)
- Computers that act as both a server and a clinet on the same local network is a peer-to-peer network.
- Basic advanteages:
  - easy set up , low cost, less complex
- Basic disadvantages:
  - not scalable, not as secure, slow performance

## Peer-to-peer Applicaiton (2.1.4)
-  P2P applicaiotn requires that each end devices have a user interface and a background service.
  - Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory (unlike whatsapp which goes through a whatsapp servers)

## a single computer can run muliple types of server software can can connect to muliple hosts. Also a client computer can have muliple client softwares.

## Three catagores of network components
- End devices (aka. Host devices) : laptops, printers, phone, camera...
  - An end device (or host) is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network, as shown in the animation. In order to uniquely identify hosts, addresses are used.
- intermediary devices : switchs, routers,
- network media:
  - Lan (local area network media) : ethernet cable
  - wan (wide area network media):fiber optic cables
  - Wireless Media : radio frequency , infrared waves

## ISP's
- An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet.
- additional services : These services can include email accounts, network storage, and website hosting and automated backup or security services.
- never use a moddem to directly connecta end device to an ISP. Instead, have wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP.  The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts.
- Can be run over DSL(over phone lines) or Cable(over cable tv lines)
  - DSL requires a high speed moden to seperate the 3 connections: phone, downlowad, and upload
  - Cable require a modem to seperate the internet from the others.
- Cellular, satalite , and dial up telephone are also other options.
