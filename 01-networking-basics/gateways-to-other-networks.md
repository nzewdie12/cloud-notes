- The defualt gateway for a host is the routers interface (the port) in which the host's package would go thorugh. Each network/subnetwork has its own router interface.
- The default IPv4 address that the router gets(the default gateway)is usualy the first host address on the network.
- The wireless router is able to translate many internal IPv4 addresses to the same public address, by using NAT.
